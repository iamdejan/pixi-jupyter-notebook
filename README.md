# Pixi Jupyter Notebook

This repository will be used to run Jupyter notebook locally. Some uses cases are:
- To run `shap` library for Explainable AI. Since the newer versions introduce a breaking change in the shap values format, we need an isolated local environment.
- Ro run Jupyter notebook locally, since I only have free plan.

## Prerequisites

- `pixi` by prefix.dev.

## Setup

1) Clone this repository.

## Start Jupyter Notebook

Run `pixi run lab`.
